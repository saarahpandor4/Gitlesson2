completed week 1's first project and so far I feel even though I am only a week into the course I have gained alot of knowledge around html and css. I still feel like I have alot to learn. There were a few bits during my time working on the website where I was stuck and I did browse through and searched online for some answers. One of the main things I couldnt get through was adding a tab on the website which was supposed to be at the bottom of the page saying 'read more', however I just couldnt get it to work. Not sure what I was doing wrong, however after numerous attempts and searching online I did end up leaving out as it was just consuming too much time so thought of changing things up slightly. Overall it was a good experience and a challenge for me.
